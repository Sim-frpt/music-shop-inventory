    'Arturia MicroFreak',
    'With so many synthesis features packed into such a small box, it’s hard not to fall in love with Arturia’s latest hardware offering. The multiple oscillator modes cover a near-endless range of timbres; the filter is smooth and versatile; the Matrix invites exploratory modulation; and the performance and sequencing tools are the icing on the creative cake. However, the real magic lies in the combo of all these together, making this odd little beast far more than the sum of its parts. MicroFreak should be top of your ‘must try’ list. ',

    'Korg Minilogue XD',
    'This new model slots comfortably into the Logue range between the original Minilogue and the Prologue 8. If we had to choose between this and the original Minilogue, it’d be the XD due to its more powerful sequencer, extended general versatility, user-customisable Multi-Engine/effects, the joystick for real-time control, user scales/tunings, more inspiring vibe and excellent motion-sequenceable stereo effects/output. Along with the new damper pedal jack and dual-CV inputs (to interface with modular gear), the XD is a nicely different flavour of Minilogue, and its unique personality is a hugely welcome addition to the range as a whole.

    'Ludwig Classic Maple 3pc Drum Set',
    'The sound this drum set offers is timeless. Ludwig has always been extremely advanced when it comes to making straight maple shells. This Classic Ludwig set is a perfect choice for professionals looking for tonal versatility. It offers a wide tuning range with a sharp attack for live performances.

    This set includes a 7-ply shell, bearing edge, and RFST molding. All mounting hardware will be included with this set, giving the user an easy way to start playing!

    The bearing edge was designed carefully to achieve that unique Ludwig Sound. It is hand-sanded. The smooth, flat surface makes the head seating easy. Another great feature of Ludwig USA shells is that they are all made using Radio Frequency Shell Technology (RFST). This increases stability throughout the entire drum.

    Does the Classic Maple series have any disadvantages? Not really – besides the fact that it requires cymbals to be purchased separately. This is expected. However, some drummers like purchasing a complete drum set. Other than this, the Ludwig Classic Maple is a great set to have and one that will allow drummers to rock out to amazing tunes.',
